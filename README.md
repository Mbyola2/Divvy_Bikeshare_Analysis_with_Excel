# üö≤ Divvy_Bikeshare_Analysis: Members vs. Casual Riders

## üéØ Project Overview
This project leverages Divvy BikeShare trip data to conduct a comprehensive analysis of how annual members and casual riders utilize the bike-sharing service differently. The insights aim to inform strategic decisions for optimizing operations, marketing, and converting casuals to members for Divvy BikeShare.

## ‚ùì Business Question
**"How do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently, and what are the key implications for Divvy BikeShare's business strategy?"**

## üìÇ Data Source & Tools
* **Data Source:** Divvy BikeShare trip data (CSV files for a full year, e.g., January 2024 - December 2024).  <https: <a href=" <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank"> Raw Data </a>
* **Tools Used:**
    * **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning, transformation, complex pivot table analysis, and advanced charting.
    * **Microsoft Word:** For the comprehensive project report detailing methodology and findings.
    * **Google Cloud Storage:** Utilized for hosting the large Excel workbook containing raw data and detailed analysis (due to GitHub file size limits).

## üí° Executive Summary & Key Insights


1.  **Members Drive Volume, Casuals Drive Seasonal Peaks:**
    * Members consistently account for **~63%** of all rides, forming the core user base.
    * Casual riders demonstrate extreme seasonality, with usage **surging dramatically in summer months (e.g., July/August)** and dropping significantly in winter.
   

2.  **Distinct Daily Usage Patterns:**
    * **Members** show high, consistent ridership during **weekdays**, indicating commuting or routine use.
    * **Casual riders** exhibit pronounced peaks on **weekends**, suggesting leisure or recreational usage.
   3.  **Casual Riders Take Longer Trips:**
    * On average, casual riders take significantly **longer trips** compared to members across all days of the week. This points to recreational or exploration-based use.
   

4.  **Rideable Type Preference:**
    * Both user types primarily use classic and electric bikes.
    * However, casual riders show a relatively higher proportion of **electric scooter** usage compared to members, hinting at different preferences for short, effortless trips.

## üìà Methodology (Brief Overview)

* **Data Acquisition & Combining:** Loaded 12 monthly CSV files using Excel Power Query. Files were combined and transformed, leveraging consistent column structures.
* **Data Cleaning:** Filtered rows, removed unwanted columns. Specifically addressed negative 'ride length' values by using the absolute value (ABS) function and removing inconsistent records to ensure data integrity.
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculated `ride_length` from start/end times.
* **Analysis:** Utilized Excel's pivot tables and charting features to identify trends, aggregations, and comparisons across user types, time periods (monthly, daily), and rideable types.
