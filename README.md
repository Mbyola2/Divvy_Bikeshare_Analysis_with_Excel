## üìà Methodology (Brief Overview)

* **Data Acquisition & Combining:** Loaded 12 monthly CSV files using Excel Power Query. Files were combined and transformed, leveraging consistent column structures.
* **Data Cleaning:** Filtered rows, removed unwanted columns. Specifically addressed negative 'ride length' values by using the absolute value (ABS) function and removing inconsistent records to ensure data integrity.
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculated `ride_length` from start/end times.
* **Analysis:** Utilized Excel's pivot tables and charting features to identify trends, aggregations, and comparisons across user types, time periods (monthly, daily), and rideable types.
